How to use:
- Open the GitHub Project from the repository Projects tab and create columns named `Backlog`, `In Progress`, `Review`, `Done`.
- Add the issues above as cards under `Backlog`.
- Move cards to `In Progress` when work starts and to `Review` when a PR is ready.

If you'd like, I can also create the Project board via the GitHub API and add the cards automatically. Say the word and I'll create it and return the project URL.
