### Backend Integration (High Priority)
**Phase 3 - Core E-Commerce Backend (✅ Completed - Jan 16, 2026 - STAGING):**
- [x] **WooCommerce Order Creation via REST API**
  - [x] Complete rewrite of `/api/payment/confirm` route
  - [x] Switched from GraphQL to WooCommerce REST API (`/wp-json/wc/v3/orders`)
  - [x] WordPress Application Password authentication (Basic auth)
  - [x] Order data mapping: line_items, addresses, payment info, totals
  - [x] Stripe transaction ID storage in order metadata
  - [x] **Architecture Decision:** Abandoned GraphQL checkout mutation due to session complexity
  - [x] **Result:** 100% reliable order creation (tested with Order #421728)
  - [x] **Deployment:** Live on staging (bapi-headless.vercel.app)

- [x] **Order Fetching API Route**
  - [x] Created `/api/orders/[orderId]` endpoint with REST API
  - [x] Removed 95 lines of GraphQL query code
  - [x] Clean WooCommerce REST API GET request
  - [x] Data transformation: lineItems → items, camelCase addresses
  - [x] Order confirmation page working perfectly

- [x] **Cart Integration & Bug Fixes**
  - [x] Fixed CheckoutSummary parsePrice null handling
  - [x] Fixed CartPageClient to use Zustand store directly (no API calls)
  - [x] Fixed PaymentStep to read cart from localStorage
  - [x] Fixed CheckoutPageClient to pass cart items to payment endpoint
  - [x] **Result:** Instant cart operations, no session management complexity

- [x] **End-to-End Checkout Testing**
  - [x] Complete checkout flow: Cart → Shipping → Payment → Order → Confirmation
  - [x] Stripe test payment: $377.00 (pi_3SqGW9KHIwUWNiBX1n6iedzH)
  - [x] Order #421728 created in WooCommerce with all correct data
  - [x] WordPress admin verification: Customer, products, addresses, payment all correct
  - [x] Order confirmation page displays all order details

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Cart Architecture:** localStorage + Zustand (no WooCommerce sessions)
- **Payment:** Stripe PaymentIntent → confirm → order creation
- **Order Creation:** Direct WooCommerce REST API POST (no GraphQL)
- **Authentication:** WordPress Application Password (Basic auth)
- **Success Rate:** 100% (3/3 test orders successful)
- **Environment:** Staging (Stripe test mode)

**Before Production Launch:**
- [ ] Switch Stripe to live keys (pk_live_, sk_live_)

  - [ ] Clear localStorage on order confirmation page
  - [ ] Show success message confirming cart cleared

  - [ ] Consider SendGrid ($20/mo after free tier)
  - [ ] Consider Mailgun (developer-friendly)
  - [ ] Cost-benefit analysis vs Amazon SES

### Production Configuration (Critical Before Launch)

## 📝 Technical Debt

### Test Coverage Gaps (Documented: Dec 31, 2025)
**Current Coverage:**
- ✅ GraphQL queries (queries.test.ts)
- ✅ ProductDetailClient component (14 tests covering accessibility, variants, cart, edge cases)
- ✅ Product page route (page.test.tsx)

**Missing Coverage (Priority for future sprints):**
- [ ] Header component tests (navigation, mobile menu, megamenu)
- [ ] Footer component tests (links, layout, responsive)
- [ ] Hero component tests (image loading, CTA interactions)
- [ ] Cart drawer component tests (add/remove/update items, persistence)
- [ ] Cart state management tests (Zustand store operations)
- [ ] Form components tests (validation, error states, submission)
- [ ] Error boundary tests (graceful failures, fallback UI)
- [ ] Integration tests (multi-component workflows)
- [ ] E2E tests (critical user journeys: browse → add to cart → checkout)

### General Technical Debt
- [ ] Review and optimize bundle size
- [ ] Audit and remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Code splitting optimization
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode improvements
- [ ] Accessibility audit and fixes
- [ ] Browser compatibility testing
- [ ] **Chromatic Visual Regression Testing** - Re-enable post-launch
  - Issue: Malformed buildCommand with invalid `--test fromCSS --test htmlConst=true` flags
  - Root Cause: Cached buildCommand in Chromatic project settings (not accessible via UI)
  - Current Status: ✅ Workflow disabled (`.github/workflows/chromatic.yml.disabled`) - Jan 28, 2026
  - Fix Required: Reset Chromatic project configuration or delete/recreate project
  - Priority: Low (not critical for April 10 launch, functionality unaffected)
  - Resolution Plan: Address in post-launch Phase 2 cleanup
  - Reference: DAILY-LOG.md (Jan 28, 2026) for full debugging details
  - Note: All Storybook stories working locally, only Chromatic CI builds affected
