## Executive Summary

Belimo is BAPI's largest competitor and the established market leader with 50 years of industry presence. While they have strong brand recognition, extensive product portfolio, and corporate resources, their website suffers from information overload and outdated user experience. BAPI has significant opportunities to compete through superior digital experience, faster information access, and modern technical resources.

## ⚠️ Weaknesses (Where BAPI Can Win)

### 1. Overwhelming Homepage Design
**Problem:** Information overload with poor user experience
- **10+ major content sections** on a single scrolling page:
  1. Hero product launch banner
  2. Product categories (3 sections)
  3. Latest News (8 articles)
  4. Industry trends
  5. Data center solutions
  6. 50-year anniversary
  7. CESIM methodology
  8. UL certifications
  9. Sustainability
  10. Energy Valve™
  11. Room sensors
  12. Building IoT
  13. Investor Relations
  14. Mission & Values
  15. Careers
- **No clear primary CTA** - what should users do first?
- **Poor visual hierarchy** - everything seems equally important
- **Cognitive overload** - difficult to process so much information
- **Feels more like a corporate portal than a sales/marketing tool**

**BAPI Advantage:** Clean, focused hero section with clear user paths. Industry browse cards provide organized navigation without overwhelming users.

### 2. Outdated Design & User Experience
**Problems identified:**
- **Intrusive cookie banner** (Cookiebot) - blocks content immediately
- **Old-school corporate aesthetic** - doesn't feel modern or innovative
- **Heavy text blocks** without visual appeal or breathing room
- **Lacks clean, spacious design** of modern B2B websites
- **No apparent search functionality** in main navigation (major UX issue)
- **Static, traditional layout** - not dynamic or engaging
- **Generic stock photography** in some sections

**BAPI Advantage:** Modern Next.js 15 with React 19, clean design language, prominent search with instant results, optimized images with WebP/CDN.

### 3. Navigation Complexity
**Issues:**
- **Product browsing unclear** - not immediately obvious how to find specific products
- **Menus not visible** in scraped content (JavaScript-heavy implementation)
- **Industry-specific pages** not prominently featured on homepage
- **Missing product selector tools** or guided product finding
- **No visible product search** in header

- **Lack of breadcrumbs** for orientation

**BAPI Advantage:** Triple browse options (Industry, Product Category, Sensor Type), mega menu with visual icons, search with instant dropdown, clear product paths.

### 4. Technical Documentation Access
**Problems:**
- **No dedicated Resources section** visible on homepage
- **Technical docs appear buried** in individual product pages
- **No visible access to:**
  - CAD drawings
  - Installation guides
  - Datasheets
  - Application notes
  - White papers
- **Engineers must hunt** for technical information
- **Friction in finding specifications** and documentation

**BAPI Advantage:** Dedicated Resources section with 1,100+ PDFs instantly searchable, 61 Application Notes with full-text search, filters by document type, prominent access from homepage.

### 5. E-commerce/Sales Flow Gaps
**Missing elements:**
- **No visible shopping cart** or e-commerce functionality
- **No product pricing** displayed
- **Unclear purchasing process** - how do customers actually buy?
- **No distributor locator** on homepage
- **No "Request Quote" CTA** prominently displayed
- **Missing "Buy Now" or "Add to Cart"** buttons
- **No user accounts** or order history visible

**BAPI Advantage:** Full Clerk authentication, user accounts with order history, favorites system, quote request form, cart functionality, clear purchase paths.

### 6. Mobile Experience (Inferred)
**Likely issues:**
- **Content overload** would be overwhelming on mobile screens
- **Cookie banner** takes up significant mobile real estate
- **Endless scrolling** through 15+ sections
- **Large images** likely not optimized for mobile bandwidth
