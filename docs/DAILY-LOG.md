### WPGraphQL Smart Cache Installation & Configuration ✅ COMPLETED

**Strategic Planning:**
- User requested performance optimization work on WordPress GraphQL backend
- Database analysis revealed 608 products, 5,438 users, extensive custom B2B fields
- Goal: Enable Smart Cache and Redis for faster GraphQL queries
- Target: Reduce 4+ second query times

**Database Discovery (Kinsta SSH Analysis):**
- **608 Products** with custom WooCommerce fields
- **5,438 WordPress Users** (large customer base)
- **Custom B2B Fields:**
  - Customer groups: `customer_group1/2/3` (5,427 users)
  - Pricing multipliers: `multiplier_buyresell/humidpres/mfg` (5,427 users)
  - Primary address fields
- **Custom Product Metadata:**
  - `compliancy_logos` (497 products)
  - `product_documents` (497 products)
  - `product_videos` (447 products)
  - `part_number` (only ~20 products - sparse usage)
- **Plugin Status:**
  - ✅ WPGraphQL 2.5.3 - Active
  - ✅ WPGraphQL for WooCommerce 0.19.0 - Active
  - ✅ WPGraphQL Smart Cache 2.0.1 - Installed but NOT configured
  - ❌ No GraphQL cache tables in database

**Implementation - Smart Cache Configuration:**
- **Configured via WP-CLI:**
  ```bash
  wp option update graphql_general_settings '{
    "public_introspection_enabled":"on",
    "cache_enabled":"on",
    "cache_expiration":"3600",
    "network_cache_enabled":"on",
    "network_cache_max_age":"3600"
  }' --format=json
  ```
- **Settings Applied:**
  - Object cache enabled (1 hour expiration)
  - Network cache enabled (1 hour max-age)
  - Cache-control headers for CDN caching

**Implementation - Cache Headers MU Plugin:**
- **Created:** `wp-content/mu-plugins/graphql-cache-headers.php`
- **Purpose:** Add proper Cache-Control headers for CDN edge caching
- **Headers:** `public, max-age=3600, stale-while-revalidate=86400`
- **Result:** Headers verified in curl responses

**Redis Object Cache Discovery:**
- **Already Enabled:** Redis was already connected and working
- **Status Verified:**
  - PhpRedis 6.2.0 (fastest PHP Redis client)
  - Redis 7.2.5
  - 25+ metrics recorded (actively caching)
  - Drop-in valid and working
- **Kinsta Dashboard:** Redis plugin installed and active

**Performance Testing Results:**
- **Before Smart Cache:** 4.177s (cold)
- **After Smart Cache (WordPress):** 3.48-3.75s (object cache active)
- **Improvement:** ~15-20% at WordPress level
- **Cache Status:** GraphQL responses show cache hits
- **Response Headers:**
  - `cache-control: max-age=3600` ✅ (working)
  - `x-graphql-keys` ✅ (cache key validation)
  - `cf-cache-status: DYNAMIC` ❌ (CDN bypassing)
  - `ki-cache-status: BYPASS` ❌ (Kinsta policy)

**Frontend Performance Analysis:**
- **Tested Vercel Edge Network:**
  - First request: 6.553s (Next.js + WordPress)
  - Second request: **0.305s** (95% faster!)
- **Caching Layers Working:**
  - ✅ Vercel Edge Network
  - ✅ Next.js ISR (1-hour revalidation)
  - ✅ React cache() (deduplication)
- **User Experience:** Users see 300ms page loads (not 4s)

**CDN Investigation:**
- **Kinsta Dashboard Analysis:**
  - `/graphql` NOT in CDN exclusion list ✅
  - Edge Caching enabled ✅
  - Cache headers properly set ✅
  - CDN still bypassing (Kinsta security policy for dynamic endpoints)
- **Decision:** Don't contact Kinsta support
  - Frontend caching already solves the problem
  - WordPress queries only run once per hour (ISR)
  - Users never experience the 3-4s delay
  - Adding CDN would be premature optimization

**Documentation Created:**
- **SMART-CACHE-INSTALLATION.md:**
  - Complete installation guide
  - Configuration steps (WP-CLI and dashboard)
  - Performance testing procedures
  - Kinsta CDN configuration notes
  - Rollback instructions
  - Related documentation links

**Files Modified:**
- **WordPress Database:**
  - `wp_options.graphql_general_settings` - Smart Cache config

- **WordPress Filesystem:**
  - `wp-content/mu-plugins/graphql-cache-headers.php` - CDN headers

- **Project Documentation:**
  - `docs/SMART-CACHE-INSTALLATION.md` - Installation guide

**Git Workflow:**
- Branch: `feature/install-smart-cache`
- Commits:
  1. `docs: add Smart Cache installation and configuration guide`
  2. `docs: update Smart Cache guide with Redis status and performance results`
- Pushed to GitHub
- Ready for PR review

**Performance Summary:**
- **WordPress Level:** 15-20% improvement (Smart Cache + Redis)
- **Frontend Level:** 95% improvement (Vercel Edge + Next.js ISR)
- **User Experience:** 300ms page loads (cached)
- **System Architecture:** Multi-layer caching working effectively

**Strategic Insights:**
- **B2B Features:** Customer groups and pricing multipliers need GraphQL exposure
- **Part Number Field:** Sparsely used (~20/608), always fallback to SKU in UI
- **Large User Base:** 5,438 WordPress users migrated to Clerk successfully
- **Custom Metadata:** Extensive product customization beyond standard WooCommerce
- **Frontend Optimization:** Already solving performance issues, backend caching is supplementary

**Impact:**
- ✅ Smart Cache configured and working (object cache layer)
- ✅ Redis connected and actively caching
- ✅ Cache headers properly set for CDN
- ✅ GET requests enabled by default in WPGraphQL v2.x
- ✅ Frontend caching verified fast (300ms)
- ✅ Database schema documented for AI agents

### BackToTop Button Fix ✅ COMPLETED

**Issue Identified:**
- User reported BackToTop button only appearing at footer (bottom of page content)
- Expected behavior: Button should appear after scrolling 300px anywhere on page
- Console logs showed logic working correctly (visible: true at 300px)
- Button was rendering but not visible in correct position

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Investigated z-index issues (z-100 invalid, changed to z-[1080])
- Tested various CSS approaches (opacity, scale, translate)
- Moved component outside provider wrappers (ToastProvider, TranslationProvider)
- **Discovered:** `transform: translateZ(0)` on body element in globals.css
- This CSS property creates a new containing block for `position: fixed`
- Caused fixed positioning to behave like absolute positioning relative to body content

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Removed problematic CSS:**
  - Deleted `transform: translateZ(0)` from body element
  - Deleted `backface-visibility: hidden` (also causes stacking issues)
  - Originally added for "hardware acceleration" but broke fixed positioning

- **Enhanced BackToTop Component:**
  - Implemented React Portal (`createPortal`) to render directly to `document.body`
  - Bypasses any parent CSS that might interfere with positioning
  - Inline position styles to prevent overrides
  - Proper z-index (1080) matching design tokens
  - Smooth transitions and hover effects

**Technical Details:**
- CSS Properties that break `position: fixed`:
  - `transform` (any value except none)
  - `filter` (any value except none)
  - `perspective` (any value except none)
  - `contain: layout` or `contain: paint`
  - `will-change: transform` or `will-change: filter`
- These create new stacking contexts and containing blocks

**Files Modified:**
- `web/src/app/globals.css` - Removed transform from body
- `web/src/components/layout/BackToTop.tsx` - Added Portal, inline positioning
- `web/src/app/layout.tsx` - Moved BackToTop outside providers

**Git Workflow:**
- Branch: `fix/back-to-top-z-index`
- Commit: "fix: resolve BackToTop button visibility issue"
  - Root cause documented in commit message
  - Complete solution with React Portal
  - Restored proper BAPI brand styling
- PR merged to main
- Deployed to Vercel production
- Branch cleanup: local and remote deleted

**Testing & Verification:**
- Console logs confirmed scroll detection working (300px threshold)
- Tested with oversized red button (debugging)
- Confirmed fixed positioning now works correctly
- Button appears at 300px scroll anywhere on page
- Stays fixed to bottom-right of viewport (not page content)

**Impact:**
- ✅ BackToTop button now works as expected
- ✅ Appears after 300px scroll on any page
- ✅ Fixed to viewport, not page content
- ✅ Smooth animations and BAPI brand styling
- ✅ Proper z-index stacking (above all content)
- ✅ Production-ready implementation with Portal

**Lessons Learned:**
- Hardware acceleration tricks (`transform: translateZ(0)`) can break layout
- Always test `position: fixed` elements when adding transform properties
- React Portals are essential for overlay components (modals, tooltips, fixed buttons)
- CSS stacking contexts are complex - document thoroughly

### GraphQL Performance Optimization - Phase 2 (Completed ✅)

**Problem Identified:**
- Product pages taking 6.7-13s to load (99.97% spent in GraphQL fetching)
- Category pages timing out during build (60+ seconds)
- Build times: 3.3 minutes with 20 categories pre-rendered

**Investigation & Analysis:**
- Created comprehensive GRAPHQL-PERFORMANCE-ANALYSIS.md document
- Identified over-fetching: 50+ fields per query including related products, gallery, variations
- WordPress backend had Smart Cache plugins installed but not optimally configured
- No Redis object caching enabled ($100/month on Kinsta)

**Solution Implemented - Query Splitting:**
- Created `GetProductBySlugLight` query with only hero/above-fold data (~70% smaller payload)
- Created deferred queries:
  - `GetProductDetailsDeferred` - Description, gallery, tags
  - `GetProductVariations` - Variable product SKUs (on-demand)
  - `GetProductRelated` - Related products (separate Suspense)
- New async component: `ProductGalleryAsync` with error handling
- Updated `ProductTabsAsync` and `RelatedProductsAsync` to use deferred queries
- All async components wrapped in Suspense boundaries with loading states

**Solution Implemented - Build Optimization:**
- Removed categories from `generateStaticParams` (on-demand ISR only)
- Pre-render only 5 top product pages (SEO value)
- Build time reduced: 3.3min → 6.9s (28x faster!)
- Categories render on first visit with ISR caching (1-hour revalidation)

**Solution Implemented - Category Optimization:**
- Reduced `GetProductsByCategory` from 50 → 10 products
- 80% smaller payload per category page
- Better UX with faster initial load

**Backend Configuration:**
- Verified WPGraphQL Smart Cache 2.0.1 installed and configured
- Network Cache max-age: 3600s ✓
- Object Cache enabled: 3600s ✓
- Enabled Redis on Kinsta ($100/month)
- Installed and activated Redis Object Cache plugin
- Verified Redis 7.2.5 connected via PhpRedis client

**Performance Results:**
